# EEG and Kinematic Data

Relied on the MNE library to analyze the EEG data gathered with the headset Enobio 32. I have uploaded the data of the participants as well as some sample scripts used to plot their brain activity.

Furthermore, I have included the kinematic data the Kinect 2.0 gathered during the training of both the experimental and control groups.

The raw data was cleaned via Python as some of the markers I employed were inaccurate.

# Master Thesis

Thesis on rhythmic queues and motor entrainment. A breakdown of the project is given in the abstract of the PDF.

The audio scripts are bound to the RGS system at the SPECS lab, hence they depend on the system to fully operate. The brain data can be fully interpreted and recreated with the uploaded python scripts.

Alas, they could be more modular to better readjust for similar experiments. 

## General Summary

Determining of rhythmic entrainment in healthy upper limb movements:

This research project was developed at the SPECS lab (Synthetic, Perceptive, Emotive and Cognitive Systems) in conjunction with the Pompeu Fabra University under the supervision of Dr. Martina Meier and completed in September 2019. 

I modified a proprietary virtual reality rehabilitation motor system to gauge whether auditory stimuli are pivotal in upper limb motor skill learning in healthy individuals. Although the results did show that this was the case, noisy data from the EEG implemented in the experiment showed that sound cues may not be fully responsible for the improvement of the aforementioned motor skills.

## Abstract 

A stroke is a traumatizing event that triggers several impairments. Individuals who have withstood it may be disabled to the extend where basic actions in both the realms of fine and gross motor skills are an undertaking. Rehabilitation methods are aplenty, whether they are successful is an ongoing discussion that has ushered the development of novel protocols. Including ones that merge virtual reality and music therapy. In this research, the "Spheroids" motor rehabilitation protocol from the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) was sonified to gauge its effectiveness in healthy individuals. If motor skills in this sample were to be increased, this should translate to patients with hemiparesis. Rhythmic entrainment was the focus of the thesis since anticipation and mental training of movements seem to be a key function in the motor system. Our results showed significance on the level of performance in the subjects who played the sonified version of the game. We concluded that while the developed sound cue may not have been solely responsible for the success in the experimental group, it does shed a light on how pivotal auditory stimuli are in motor skill learning.

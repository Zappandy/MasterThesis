# Master Thesis

Thesis on rhythmic queues and motor entrainment. A breakdown of the project is given in the abstract of the PDF.

The audio scripts are bound to the RGS system at the SPECS lab, hence they depend on the system to fully operate. The brain data can be fully interpreted and recreated with the uploaded python scripts.

Alas, they could be more modular to better readjust for similar experiments. 

## General Summary

Determining of rhythmic entrainment in healthy upper limb movements:

This research project was developed at the SPECS lab (Synthetic, Perceptive, Emotive and Cognitive Systems) in conjunction with the Pompeu Fabra University under the supervision of Dr. Martina Meier and completed in September 2019. 

I modified a proprietary virtual reality rehabilitation motor system to gauge whether auditory stimuli are pivotal in upper limb motor skill learning in healthy individuals. Although the results did show that this was the case, noisy data from the EEG implemented in the experiment showed that sound cues may not be fully responsible for the improvement of the aforementioned motor skills.
